# My Pencil Revolution

 You are now in charge of creating a system that would efficiently produce and sell pencils, with the ultimate goal of making sure everyone on the planet (or the galaxy) has enough pencils forever.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
GNU C++: https://gcc.gnu.org/install/
Qt: https://www.qt.io/download
NetBeans: https://netbeans.org/downloads/8.2/ (be sure to use version 8.x as version 9 and upwards no longer support C++)
CMake: https://cmake.org/install
Doxygen: https://sourceforge.net/projects/doxygen/
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Place the follwoing step into terminal to build the project.

```
mkdir build && cd build && cmake ..
```

You can now make the project

```
make
```

To execute the project you need to run
```
./src/Pencils
```

to execute the testing

```
./test/test-pencils
```

and to make docs run

```
make doc
```

and then the documentation can be found in the directory `doc` and in the directory `doc`.
## Built With

* [QT5](qt.io) - The GUI framework used
* [Cmake](https://cmake.org) - Dependency Management
